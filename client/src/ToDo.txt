next feature : User List 

-> frontend useState change for every new user (join_room),
-> Backend stores Map (user data , room state) -> next if Files state and data. (send this for refresh , etc...)
-> User status (is complex thing) => 1.Online and offline is easy (socketio)
                                     2.editing (code_delta socket)
                                     3.Reading (Later File system and Auth)


-> Also setup Name in Cursor








1.The onl mistake You have done is 

  a. Not knowing about the Feature (flow , what are needed(real time , Id , granulas , useEffect or other , useState or useRef , is user involved or not (userId) , [first principle] etc... Stuff like that )) then decide code.

        As you have done in Previous projects.
        Instead you gave feature and told to Build


        After Building Your minimal code Own : Optimize and clean With AntiGravity (not web LLM's XXXXXXX(worst way to code also understand CodeBase))


        -> web LLM's are only for Teaching

    

Next : Feature 1 => 1.Code Block Sync (Indepth research of feature)
